# progress

Prioritized tasks that are currently in progress.

- [ ] I should be able to provide my own code for a route/resource/event

## to do

- [ ] bug: `rx init` shouldn't overwrite a file if it exists. Can overwrite with `--force`.
- [ ] bug: the CORS headers should be added to all operations, not just `OPTIONS`
- [ ] bug: all errors should be friendly, unless verbose is on.
- [ ] feature: all log output history should be stored like git log or reflog format.
